# Product Bundles - Min/Max Items

### Important

**Product Bundles - Min/Max Items** has been rolled into Product Bundles. If you are running Product Bundles 6.4.0 or newer, you don't need this plugin!

### What's This?

Free mini-extension for [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/) that allows you to control the minimum or maximum quantity of bundled products that customers must choose in order to purchase a Product Bundle.

### How It Works

Out of the box, [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/) does not include any options for selling fixed- or variable-size bundles, such as cases of wine, six-packs of soap, or candy boxes.

The plugin adds two new options under **Product Data > Bundled Products**:

* **Items required (≥)**; and
* **Items allowed (≤)**.

You can use these options to define a lower or upper quantity of items that customers must choose to purchase their own custom bundle.
