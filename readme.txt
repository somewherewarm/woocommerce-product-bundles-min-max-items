Free mini-extension for WooCommerce Product Bundles that allows you to control the minimum or maximum quantity of bundled products that customers must choose in order to purchase a Product Bundle.


== Description ==

**Product Bundles - Min/Max Items** has been rolled into [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/). If you have updated to Product Bundles version 6.4.0 or newer, you don't need this plugin!

**Important**: This plugin is a free add-on for the official [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/) extension. It was created to validate and refine a feature that is now included with Product Bundles.


== Documentation ==

This plugin adds two new options under **Product Data > Bundled Products**:

* **Items required (≥)**; and
* **Items allowed (≤)**.

Once you have used these options to set a minimum or maximum quantity limit, customers must choose a quantity of products within the specified range to make a purchase.


== Installation ==

This plugin works requires the official [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/) extension to work. Please do not install this if you are using Product Bundles version 6.4.0+.
